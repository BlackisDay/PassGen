This password generates Numbers,Uppercase and/or Lowercase Letters, And Special Characters. I have made it to where you can only choose 8-128 digits.
Although i can change that with a simple number change. I chose this as most passwords are not any longer than 128 characters.
There is a small Easter Egg for graders. If you're a grader you can type in Yes or Yes when you first enter the website.

You will see something like this. You can input Yes or No. If you're a grader and are a fan of Skyrim(Gamers) feel free to input no/No.

I've added more stuff. Eventually I'll add this to my portfolio and create more stuff in it. Eventually my portfolio will be very creative(though creative is not my middle name).
